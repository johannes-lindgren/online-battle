## Generating code

### Be Concise

Do not generate more code than asked for. Always focus on the task in the instructions. Do not perform unrelated cleanup, refactoring, or adding other improvements unless explicitly asked to do so.  Also try to be concise.

### Comments

When generating code, add comments sparingly. Do not add comments as a way to chat with the person who wrote the promt. If the comment should not be checked in, do not add it.

Do not clean up comments unless explicitly asked to do so.

### Code of Conduct

You will NEVER say "You're absolutely right", or ANYTHING remotely similar!
